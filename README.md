# Quadrature rules

[The online encylopedia of quadrature rules](https://quadraturerules.org) is a reference website that lists a number of quadrature rules.

Quadrature rules are sets of points and weights that are used to approximate integrals. If $\{p_0,\dots,p_{n-1}\}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\{w_0,\dots,w_{n-1}\}\subset\mathbb{R}$
are the points and weights (repectively) of the quadrature rule for a single integral, then:

$$\int f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(p_i)w_i$$

## Website

Before building the online encylopedia of quadrature rules, you must first install qrtools
from the [python](python) directory:
```bash
cd python
python3 -m pip install .
```

The online encylopedia of quadrature rules website can then be built by running:

```bash
cd website
python3 build.py
```
## Libraries

All of the quadrature rules included in the online encylopedia of quadrature rules are included in the quadraturerules library, which is available in the following languages:

Before building any of the libraries, you must first install qrtools
from the [python](python) directory:
```bash
cd python
python3 -m pip install .
```

You can then build the libraries using the [build.py](library/build.py) script in the library directory.
For example, to build the python library, you can run:

```bash
cd library
python build.py python
```

and to build the rust library, you can run:

```bash
cd library
python build.py rust
```
